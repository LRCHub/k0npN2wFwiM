Kiss the sun
In your eyes
Love unveiled
I can't deny
Be not warned
Watch it fall
Mesmerize...

Close your eyes and begin to breath
Something is coming over me
Lost to find, and a soul to keep
Cause you love me...

Give this one
On bended knee
Price to pay
Please wait for me
A trial by fire
A setting Sun
A love I've won...

Close your eyes and begin to breath
Something is coming over me
Lost to find, and a soul to keep
Cause you love me...

Inside, I wait
Inside, I wait

Kiss the sun
In your eyes
Love unveiled
I can't deny
Be not warned
Watch it fall
Mesmerize...

Close your eyes and begin to breath
Something is coming over me
Lost to find, and a soul to keep
Cause you love me...

Inside, I wait
Inside, I wait

Close your eyes and begin to breath
Something is coming over me
Lost to find, and a soul to keep
Cause you love me
You love me
You love me
You love me...
