Say, now listen here
I wanna be, oh so clear
I lost myself, and lost I'll stay
Between my friends, and malaise

And here I am, frail
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare

Tug at my sleeve
My little girl, my sweet Marie
And she don't know how bad I am
Stole my smile from a cheshire cat

And all I wanted
Was to be happy
And since I gave up I feel free
I feel free, I feel free, I feel free

Two of us less dangerous
It's all inside our heads
Givin' in for nothin' less
Leavin' me for you

Try
To understand
The ones I love
And their demands

It's so unfair
When they can't see
That I'm the boy
That really needs

Their love
Has failed

Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the
Frail and bedazzled from all the glare
